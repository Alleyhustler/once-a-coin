            <p>If you are reading this, then I finally managed to escape. This is no place for life and I suggest you turn around... but is that even possible? This house knows what it wants. If you wanted to leave, and the house disagreed, could you?</p>
            <p>When I was young and afraid I found this house in the woods, where I took refuge from the prevailing winds of life. It wasn't entirely horrible, but I know now that <em>good enough</em> doesn't equate to <em>good</em>. What lurks these halls is the Protector, a malicious spirit that aims to steal the souls of the hopeless. It first has you believe that the <em>dreamscape</em> is all there is, that the real world is dead-- only when I began being able to looked past it did I realize how dire my situation was. I believe that the Homunculus trapped the Protector someone in this house, but be on guard. If you do see the Homunculus, tell it I said hello, would you?</p>
            <p>As mentioned, this place does not reveal itself in its entirety. It is divided into the dreamscape and the real world. To fully traverse you must switch back and forth between the two-- throughout the journey you will find transition points that'll help you move between the two, indicated by being in red with a wavy underline.</p>
            <p>Gazing below will bring you into dreamscape. If you wish to proceed, good luck. You'll need it.</p>
