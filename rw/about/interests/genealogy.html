                <p>Ah, genealogy, one of my oldest loves. You would think that someone who has been doing genealogy for around 5 years would be quite far back, but my furthest is the middle of the 18th century. This is mainly because of me resetting my tree and being absolutely swamped with other responsibilities (even though I love genealogy, doing intensive research for genealogy after doing school-mandated intensive reasearch is not the most fun thing in the world!). My eventual goal is to get certified by the Board for Certification of Genealogists; I'm not sure what I would want to specialize in (maybe somewhere in Germany?), but I think it is a dream of mine. Besides that, my other goal is to go back to Europe with every single one of my lines. Right now, I need to reorganize and sort my sources which will... take quite a long time, unfortunately. Once I get that done, I'll probably focus on going further and further back!</p>
                <p>I have ancestry from the United States, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Gernany, the Netherlands, and Sweden.</p>
