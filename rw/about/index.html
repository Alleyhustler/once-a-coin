                <h2>SITE MANIFESTO</h2>
                <p>The corporate internet is boring.</p>
                <p>It is an absolute hellspawn that I can confidently say represents the worst of humanity. For every cute cat meme there are ten rage-bait disinformation posts. For all the people it has brought together, there are more people that it torn a part or had permanently psychologically ruined. And it's greatest sin of all, in my opinion, it is just SO boring! There is no personality to its deisgn! Everyone is forced into these basic molds that stand for nothing and believe in nothing, forcing their personalities through a strainer that'll just leave you mangled in the end.</p>
                <p>I don't want this to come off as holier-than-thou: I still use Instagram on occasion (main way I contact majority of my friends and it is admittedly easier to send someone a meme and start a convo from there than just randomly texting them out of the blue, especially if you aren't that close), but rather this is a <em>plea</em>: make your own website! I genuinely think making a website is accessible to all, even those who have absolutely zero interest in coding. Even just an HTML page with zero CSS styling would be infinitely better than having your main online presence be on the corporate web. I firmly believe that website creation is one of the best things you can do to show off your personality online, even if you believe you have nothing of interest to talk about (spoiler alert: you do! I want to read even the most banal of things! Before posting on your story, think about making it a blog post!)</p>
                <p>This website is thus me trying to practice what I preach. Most importantly, for me, my website represents a way to showcase myself artistically. I am absolute ass at any visual art medium, but having a website lets me be myself in its entirety. I invite you to view this site as an interactable art exhibit; I have a lot of pride in what I've made and I hope exploring makes it evident. As someone who is very academically focused, I also am using my website as a way for me to have an outlet for things I learned-- it's not very fun keeping it to yourself! I hope that people are able to learn from what I wrote and that maybe it sparks some interest in them too!</p>

                                    he&rsquo;s gone, you think, I still want<br />to be clean. If only the rain were gasoline, your tongue<br />a lit

                                    your palms<br />two puddles of rain. He dies as your heart beats faster,<br />as another war coppers the sky. He
                                    dies each night<br />you close your eyes &amp; hear his slow exhale. Your fist choking<br />the dark. Your fist
                                    through the bathroom mirror. He dies<br />at the party where everyone laughs &amp; all you want is to go<br />into
                                    the kitchen &amp; make seven omelets before burning<br />down the house. All you want is to run into the woods &amp;
                                    beg<br />the wolf to fuck you up. He dies when you wake<br />&amp; its November forever. A Hendrix record
                                    melted<br />on a rusted needle. He dies the morning he kisses you<br />for two minutes too long, when he says
                                    <em>Wait</em> followed by<br /><em>I have something to say</em> &amp; you quickly grab your favorite<br />pink
                                    pillow &amp; smother him as he cries into the soft<br />&amp; darkening fabric. You hold still until he&rsquo;s very
                                    quiet,<br />until the walls dissolve &amp; you're both standing in the crowded train<br />again. Look how it rocks
                                    you back &amp; forth like a slow dance<br />seen from the distance of years. You're still a freshman. You're
                                    still<br />terrified of having only two hands. &amp; he doesn&rsquo;t know your name yet<br />but he smiles anyway.
                                    His teeth reflected in the window<br />reflecting your lips as you mouth <em>Hello</em>&mdash;your tongue<br />a lit

                                    pressing a shank<br />to another man&rsquo;s throat. Steel turning to light<br />on sweat-slick neck. Forgive

                                    in his need to know<br />how pain blesses the body back<br />to its sinner. The hour suddenly<br />stilled. The man,
                                    his lips pressed<br />to the black boot. Am I wrong to love<br />those eyes, to see something so clear<br />&amp;

                                    There&rsquo;s a boy kneeling<br />in a house with every door kicked open<br />to summer. There&rsquo;s a question
                                    corroding<br />his tongue. A knife touching<br />Your finger lodged inside the throat.<br />Dearest Father, what
                                    becomes of the boy<br />no longer a boy? <em>Please</em>&mdash;<br />what becomes of the shepherd<br />when the

                                    laughed &amp; laughed because Hey,<br />French earlier, wasn&rsquo;t it so<br />gay? While girls I just met linked
                                    arms with me, paraded<br />me around. While teachers applauded me for becoming<br />president of the GSA,<br />then
                                    never attended another meeting. While my best friends<br />&amp; favorite grownups spent their lunches listening,
                                    their free blocks<br />listening.<br />They knew nobody is SoBrave without anybody&rsquo;s &amp;,<br />somebody
                                    else&rsquo;s Strong&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t<br />you? Why couldn&rsquo;t I tell you about the boy<br />who dumped me
                                    via his away message on AIM? Or the boy who demanded<br />I have &ldquo;anime hair&rdquo;? Or the one who kept

                                    later asked When can I see<br />you<br />again? &amp; he said Yeah<br />I don&rsquo;t think we really clicked &amp;
                                    I don&rsquo;t blame him, I brought up<br />my whole entire history with you on the first date, I mean, why<br />did

                                    about that.<br />Imagine it: me coming home, me running to you<br />to rant about a boy, &amp; you shaking your
                                    head, That boy? All wrong<br />for you anyway. If only you&rsquo;d say How right,<br />this boy, taking good care of
                                    you now.<br />OK I have to get this work done, but I&rsquo;ll<br />call you soon&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether
                                    that sentence, either part,<br />is true. Whether I&rsquo;m lying. My thumb hovers, considers<br />switching
                                    keyboards. To ask Are you ready now, 妈?<br />妈妈?</p>

                                <p>The sunflowers fall, right along with their mason jar, in the middle of the<br />night. Their heads too gloriously
                                    full of early July. How they seem to know<br />everything, except the virus. The crown it wears. All the unglory it
                                    craves.<br />Receives.</p>
                                <p>/</p>
                                <p>At Williams Sonoma the other day, a sales associate named Carol welcomes<br />the two of us to a new, touchless
                                    shopping experience. It&rsquo;s a capacious<br />Williams Sonoma, at the Natick Mall, &amp; we&rsquo;re impressed by
                                    how Carol&rsquo;s<br />voice fills the entire store. Her cheery script a lingering chime in our
                                    ears.<br />We&rsquo;re here after our usual supermarket trip, curious how the mall is<br />reopening. &amp;
                                    Carol&mdash;I know she&rsquo;s paid to sound happy about this situation,<br />as she&rsquo;s paid to ooze happiness
                                    about every Le Creuset skillet, kettle,<br />cassoulet. But she sounds far too happy.<br />\</p>
                                <p>Something wakes the dog. His barking like fistfuls of sunlight, like the sun<br />set on fire. I sit up at once,
                                    understand what he can&rsquo;t: the sunflowers, the jar,<br />on the carpet. You groan, slowly raise your right
                                    hand, the only part capable<br />of any semblance of awake. You caress the dog&rsquo;s head. His back.<br />You
                                    soften the fright away with syllable after syllable of your hand.</p>
                                <p>/</p>
                                <p>I wave to Carol as though sending her some love, though mostly it&rsquo;s<br />concern. She smiles &amp; smiles, as
                                    though the smile has kidnapped her, as<br />though her name isn&rsquo;t actually Carol, as though Williams Sonoma
                                    has given</p>
                                <p>her that name, taken all her vocabulary except smiling &amp; How may I assist<br />you??</p>
                                <p>\</p>
                                <p>I keep seeing it in slow motion, though I didn&rsquo;t actually see their falling.<br />The sunflowers, overcome with
                                    true dizzying delight&mdash;with themselves.</p>
                                <p>/</p>
                                <p>I miss seeing your delight when touching pots &amp; pans &amp; potato mashers,<br />the vast array of Le Creuset.
                                    That afternoon with one autumnally orange<br />Dutch oven. Your face, as you touched that fire. Your face whenever
                                    you<br />just have to touch the fabric of every shirt that catches your eye in H&amp;M,<br />tell me exactly how it
                                    feels. Then ask me to touch it, describe it myself. So<br />soft, yes, but in what way? Like a cloud? About to
                                    burst?</p>
                                <p>\<br />I picture Carol with sunflowers.<br />In a Williams Sonoma-approved apartment, Carol is allowed one
                                    sunflower,<br />one real happiness she can put in her own jar.<br />/</p>
                                <p>Your hand doesn&rsquo;t touch even the shirts now, though you read somewhere<br />fabrics are okay, the virus
                                    can&rsquo;t live on them, or not for long, or what are<br />the facts, today?</p>
                                <p>\</p>
                                <p>Or perhaps Carol, when she&rsquo;s not a grinning retail robot, is the patron saint<br />of sunflowers.<br />The
                                    pricey cookware, just her day job.<br />/</p>
                                <p>I miss museums. Walking around with you, coming across an exhibit that<br />exclaims, Touch me! Watching your fingers
                                    revel in being fingers on a<br />wacky new surface.<br />Then kissing you hard while that twelve-foot tall
                                    papier-mach&eacute; duck<br />watches, jealous.<br />Let there be a patron saint of making impossible birds very
                                    annoyed.</p>
                                <p>\</p>
                                <p>July 7, 2020: Over three million confirmed cases in the US. Over fifteen<br />thousand in critical condition. Over
                                    one hundred &amp; thirty-three thousand<br />dead. Over half a million dead globally.<br />/</p>
                                <p>Many of the things I miss are pretty silly. Pretty &amp; silly. &amp; I miss them<br />deeply.<br />&amp; my mother,
                                    who lives only ten minutes away by car, but hasn&rsquo;t left the<br />house in months, has insisted I not leave
                                    mine unless absolutely necessary.<br />My mother, already sick, chronically sick in three different ways. She
                                    says<br />not to send anything. How I want to send her all the sunflowers.<br />Carol, you may assist me now. If you
                                    are indeed the holy rep of sunflowers,<br />Carol&mdash;please make row after row flicker up in the night, in the
                                    worry-field<br />of my mother&rsquo;s head. Help her sleep. &amp; dream only of glowing, petal-soft<br />things.</p>
                                <p>\</p>
                                <p>Surely, there is a patron saint of touch, who yes, at the moment is struggling<br />&mdash;unlike the brand-new
                                    patron saint of branded touchless experiences,<br />whose business has only been expanding. Booming, like a
                                    dog&rsquo;s 3 a.m.<br />holler.</p>
                                <p>/</p>
                                <p>I miss walking through a museum by myself. That sweet surrounded-by-art<br />aloneness. Solitude enhanced,
                                    perfected&mdash;by unwearable pantsuits, hairy<br />suitcases.<br />I think it&rsquo;s what any artist hopes for:
                                    not only to be remembered, but to be<br />company.</p>
                                <p>\</p>
                                <p>Perhaps Carol really is overcome with joy. Thrilled, like us, to be out of the<br />apartment, away from her
                                    relentlessly beautiful dog, cat, kid. Even when it<br />means repeating the same couple of lines, a sort of
                                    depressing jingle. &amp; the<br />mask&mdash;all day. Still, she&rsquo;s out &amp; she&rsquo;s caroling about the
                                    latest sale on<br />summer grilling essentials. To people who&mdash;perhaps she&rsquo;s glad for
                                    it&mdash;<br />don&rsquo;t know her.</p>
                                <p>/</p>
                                <p>They fell? you ask in the morning, surprised to see the sunflowers strewn on<br />the carpet. Yes, I say, &amp;
                                    explain how that led to the dog barking. I add<br />something about being too lazy to pick them up, but really, I
                                    liked the way<br />they looked on the carpet, like golden messages from some other, less<br />exhausting
                                    place.<br />You pick the sunflowers up, return them to their jar after refilling it with<br />fresh tap water. You
                                    climb back in bed &amp; touch my face.<br />You climb back in bed to touch my face.<br />You wrap your arms around
                                    me &amp; it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re the patron saint of touch<br />as well as soft sunlight &amp; soothed dogs. Or
                                    you must be the earthly<br />representative of divine holding. Or you&rsquo;re both &amp; also a boy, like
                                    me,<br />holding on.</p>

                                    On my knees,</p>
                                <p><br />I watched, through the keyhole, not<br />&lrm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the man

                                <p><br />falling through him: guitar strings snapping<br />&lrm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;over his

                                <p><br />it filled me to the core<br />&lrm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;like a skeleton. Even my

                                <p><br />knelt down inside me, asking<br />&lrm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to be spared.</p>

                                <p>of entering a song&mdash;was to lose<br />&lrm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;your way back.</p>
                                <p><br />So I entered. So I lost.<br />&lrm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I lost it all with my eyes

                                    purse</p>
                                <p>to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;<br />when death comes<br />like the measle-pox</p>
                                <p>when death comes<br />like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,</p>
                                <p>I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:<br />what is it going to be like, that cottage of
                                    darkness?</p>
                                <p>And therefore I look upon everything<br />as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,<br />and I look upon time as no more
                                    than an idea,<br />and I consider eternity as another possibility,</p>
                                <p>and I think of each life as a flower, as common<br />as a field daisy, and as singular,</p>
                                <p>and each name a comfortable music in the mouth,<br />tending, as all music does, toward silence,</p>
                                <p>and each body a lion of courage, and something<br />precious to the earth.</p>
                                <p>When it's over, I want to say all my life<br />I was a bride married to amazement.<br />I was the bridegroom, taking
                                    the world into my arms.</p>
                                <p>When it's over, I don't want to wonder<br />if I have made of my life something particular, and real.</p>
                                <p>I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,<br />or full of argument.</p>
                                <p>I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.</p>
