                        <p>Film: Has to be <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>; I'm a huge fan of surrealist works and it's story is just so beautiful-- absolutely deserves all its flowers! Close second, though, is <em lang="fr">Portrait de la jeune fille en feu</em>. That ending sequence... wow.</p>

They heralded both the summer's beginning and its end-- I always secretly mourned when their songs stopped.</p>

                        <p>Bird: Mourning doves! They, too, are a fond staple of my childhood, with their calls being ubiqutous to a warm morning. I think they are rather beautiful and graceful and I appreciate their melodies.</p>

                        <p>[The following texts are an excerpt of the Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza Recitation, kindly translated from the original K'aci to English and republished, with permission, from the Bloomington Dream Society. Prior the BDS efforts, there has been zero scholarship on the fascinating folklore of the K'aci people and their culture; no where is this more evident than the famous Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza Recitation. Most likely composed in the Caucasus and whose date is the subject of active debate (having words of Malay origin pushes the text to be of later origin, probably towards the collapse of the culture in the 18th century), it is the most preserved work of K'aci literature. It's frame story is between Yu·π£oda, a householder who lives alone in the mountains but occasionally sells woodcarvings, and Myƒìni, a pilgrim to the Temple of KhaxƒÅn. It is the harshest winter in ages and Myeni's young age (atypical of pilgrims to KhaxƒÅn), along with his lack of knowledge in the customs relating to pilgrims, confuses but entices the similarly aged Yu·π£oda. The two men begin a Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza, a ritualized form of storytelling over a hot-pot equivalent and alcohol. As they discuss matters relating to the creation of the world, local gossip in neighboring towns, nightmares, and erotic adventures, the two begin falling in love with each other. The Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza Recitation ends after the blizzard lets up, with Myƒìni continuing his journey, but promising to return eventually.</p>
                        <p>The Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza Recitation is <em>long</em>, consisting of over 100 stories (all of varying length; the War of Wars is longer than all the other stories combined). As such, below are nine stories from the Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza Recitation (plus a non-Recitation story), in hopes that it sparks interest in learning more about the K'aci. These stories are "The First Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza"; "The Monster of Hjar Village"; "An Old Pilgrim Dies"; "Creation of the World"; "Lah·π≠hu·π≠ is Beheaded"; "Caw Conspires with the Gods"; "KhaxƒÅn Builds His Temple"; "The Pious Demon"; "B√´cel's Garden"; and "Discovering the Adulteress" (a non-Recitation story).</p>

                        <h3>The First Ro·πá·∏çr≈çza</h3>
                        <p><em>[The first story told in the Recitaiton, other ro·πá·∏çr≈çza collections all include this story (with variations). It is thus believed that is traditional for any ro·πá·∏çr≈çza to begin with this story. This version, however, is particularly longer with much more details; in this instance it seems to also serve as a reflection of the relation between Yu·π£oda and Myƒìni.]</em></p>
