                <p>a delightful lil minimalist website! i think the aesthetics of it are really cute <small>and just a lil silly</small></p>
                <p>highlights include <a href="https://sneekrealm.neocities.org/creations/">creations</a> and the <a href="https://sneekrealm.neocities.org/notebook/">notebook</a>; i think sneek has a really nice writing style that i enjoy big style</p>

                <div class="inline-grid">
                    <p style="grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1 / span 3;">Super cool aesthetic, reminiscent of that 90s-00s kinda eerie CGI. Has an extensive amount of shrines to look at. Highlight for me is the <a href="https://rh0mbus0fruin.neocities.org/rnmshrine">Robot and Monster</a> shrine because I literally forgot that it existed until then. Also, <a href="https://rh0mbus0fruin.neocities.org/chickenlittle">Chicken Little Hell</a>.</p>

                <div class="inline-grid">
                    <p style="grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1 / span 3;">This was the inspiration that made me realize I need to get more <em>nasty</em> with my site design. Some absolutely INCREDIBLE art and site layout. You can see the passion they have in their interests and it is inspiring! Personal favorites include <a href="https://lupinus.neocities.org/readz">Readz</a>, <a href="https://lupinus.neocities.org/ecology">Ecology</a>, <a href="https://lupinus.neocities.org/ajshrine">Animal Jam shrine</a>, and the <a href="https://lupinus.neocities.org/cast">OC page</a>!</p>

                <h2>museum of alexandra</h2>
                <p>i can confidently say that every iteration of xandra's website is an absolute treat. it's minimal but still maintains a distinct personality. i love the <a href="https://xandra.cc/art#">art gallery</a> and the <a href="https://xandra.cc/favorites/">hall of favorites</a>! xandra herself is also super nice and friendly, love her :)</p>

            <div class="box vega">
                <h2>Vega Collective</h2>
                <p>Vega Collective is one of those things that you just can't describe adequately or even artistically emulate; you just gotta see it to believe it. Probably one of the coolest websites out there; it has this disturbing quality to it and really makes you understand the limitations of your own flesh.</p>
                <p>Universe Be With U.</p>

            <div class="box dimden">
                <h2>DIMDEN</h2>
                <p>Such a cool website with a ton of hidden secrets lying about! I love the cyberpunk aesthetic it has; really reminds me of VA-11 Hall-A. The <a href="https://dimden.dev/about.html">About Me</a> and the <a href="https://album.dimden.dev/">Photo Album</a> are some of my favs from that site. They are also the creator of Nekoweb, which is neato!!</p>

            <div class="box manyface">
                <h2>manyface</h2>
                <p>i think there is no other way to describe their website other than that it is a sanctuary to art. it seems every artform they touch is skillfully mastered and done with excellence-- i'm particuarly fond of the <a href="https://manyface.neocities.org/photogallery">photography</a> and <a href="https://manyface.neocities.org/poetry">poetry</a> sections. i really enjoy <em>The Russian Dream</em> and <em>The Rejoicer</em>; i'm nothing but a whore for art that is specific to only one person's experience yet still relatable.</p>

                <h2>#NENRIKIDO</h2>
                <p>What a cute website!! This was one of the first websites I looked at when I was getting into Neocities, and it still amazes me. It has a kind of Tumblr custom theme vibe to it (in the best way possible). Also it is the responsive layout DREAM (perhaps something I should learn lol).</p>

                <h2>Mental Labour</h2>
                <p>Quite a simplistic website, but I really enjoy his insights and his writings. Very NSFW work, but I really love the vulnerability of <a href="https://mental-labour.neocities.org/journal/hate">this piece</a>. I also just like the vibes of the <a href="https://mental-labour.neocities.org/bookshelf">Bookshelf</a>. I always check this website over and over again, so I would recommend it!</p>

                <p>I LOVE POKEYMON!! the aesthetic is so good and i just love the vibes of the website, which i think is very apparent from the <a href="https://shinyexe.neocities.org/about">about</a> page. the <a href="https://shinyexe.neocities.org/frienddex">frienddex</a> is shrimply delightful and one of the inspirations for this links page. highly recommend rummaging around!</p>

                <h2>sweetfish</h2>
                <p>such a nice website!! actually a major inspiration for this design; i love the newspaper-like appearance. i haven't fully went through it, but the <a href="https://sweetfish.site/studio/games">games</a> they've made are really cool!! always love checking out <a href="https://sweetfish.site/checkout/1224">the checkout corner</a> (pun intended) and seeing their recommendations. highly recommend!!</p>

                <h2>philia995</h2>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoy the aesthetic of this site. I'm not entirely sure what to call it, but it does feel very much like a PlayStation (and DS) game in terms of design (I guess that 2010s game aesthetic?). Love the <a href="https://philia995.neocities.org/photobook">photobook</a> (put photography and I am HERE) and the <a href="https://philia995.neocities.org/cloudstrife">Cloud Strife</a> srhine.</p>

Love spending time going through the <a href="https://fizzsea.neocities.org/chara">Characters</a> page. It's just really cool!!</p>

                <h2 class="center">ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
                <p>Back in 2015, I was <em>obsessed</em> with this Twitch streamer called Blue. He played Pokémon and Animal Crossing-- but I have like, no evidence that he existed minus him being a friend on my 3DS. I'd like to know if anyone remembers who he was and what happened to him? I knew he was Indian-Canadian and gay. Really reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@angrycoconut">angry coconut</a> on YouTube.</p>
