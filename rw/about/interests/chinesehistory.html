The Qin dynasty has been established two years earlier as the first Empire of China, but the most immediate effect this has had on you has been that the years of war are finally over. Things could still be better: your sons have been conscripted to work on the massive public works projects, which you only avoided by the disability in your leg.</p>-->
                <p>I feel like it'd be impossible to not find the history of a more-or-less continous civilization of 5000 years to not be interesting. I have to admit my knoweldge of Chinese history is pretty abysmal-- I can name basically zero historical events and the only rulers I know off the top of my head are Wu Zetian and Empress Dowager Cixi. But, I want to learn more, so here we are! I have particular interest in the Tang and Song dynasties purely because I like looking at periods of high art, but contemporary China is also very interesting. Especially as a Religious Studies student, I want to investigate China (in all its forms) and its relations with various religious groups.</p>
